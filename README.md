# COVID-19 Case Prediction using LSTM Neural Network
This project aims to develop a deep learning model based on an LSTM neural network to predict new COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. The model leverages historical data from the past 30 days to forecast future case numbers. The primary objective is to achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of less than 1% on the testing dataset. The predictions are designed to support decisions about imposing or lifting travel bans.

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from MoH-Malaysia's COVID-19 public repository at the following link https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public. It consists of two CSV files for training and testing:
- cases_malaysia_train.csv: Contains historical COVID-19 case data for model training.
- cases_malaysia_test.csv: Contains recent COVID-19 case data for testing and validation.

## Project Description
The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 caused severe disruptions and loss of life worldwide. Researchers have noted that the lack of AI-assisted tracking and predictive systems contributed to the virus's rapid spread. This project employs LSTM neural networks to accurately forecast daily COVID-19 cases, offering a tool for better pandemic management.
### Challenges Faced and Solutions
Challenges:
- Data Collection: Ensuring the availability and reliability of Malaysia's daily COVID-19 case data.
- Model Optimization: Determining the optimal architecture and hyperparameters for the LSTM model.
- Error Control: Achieving a MAPE of less than 1% to ensure prediction accuracy.
  
Solutions:
- Used verified data from MoH-Malaysia's COVID-19 public repository.
- Conducted iterative experiments to identify the best model architecture and parameters.
- Applied regularization techniques and fine-tuned hyperparameters to minimize errors and improve accuracy.

### Future Challenges and Features
- Incorporating External Factors: Including variables like vaccination rates, government policies and public sentiment for better predictions.
- Real-Time Prediction: Implementing a system for real-time forecasting to assist public health authorities in making timely decisions.

## Model Criteria and Methodology
### Model Architecture
The LSTM model consists of:
- Three LSTM layers with 64 units each.
- Dropout layers to reduce overfitting (20% dropout).
- A Dense output layer for regression tasks.

### Methodology
1) Problem Definition: Predict new COVID-19 cases (cases_new) in Malaysia based on historical data.
2) Data Preprocessing: Used KNNImputer for missing values and MinMaxScaler for normalization.
3) Model Training: Configured with 100 epochs and a 30-day input window.
4) Model Evaluation: Measured performance using MAE, MAPE, and MSE.
5) Deployment: Designed for predicting unseen future data.

## Project Results
Model Performance:
- Training Loss: 0.0014
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0238
- Validation Loss: 0.0144
- MAPE on Testing Data: Below 1%
- The model demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting new cases and successfully achieved the target MAPE on the testing dataset.

## Conclusion
The project effectively utilized an LSTM neural network to predict COVID-19 cases in Malaysia with a very low error margin. This model can assist public health officials in planning and implementing timely interventions, demonstrating the potential of AI-driven solutions for pandemic management.
